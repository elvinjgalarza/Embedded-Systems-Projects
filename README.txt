This repository contains Embedded Systems projects.

These are embedded systems projects that utilize ARM Cortex Assembly and C with a breadboard, the TM4C123 LaunchPad, and Sitronix ST7735R LCD graphics display.

Lab 0 (not in repository) - Digital lock, I/O, parallel port, direction register and logic function, written in assembly
... standard initialization of the LaunchPad along with optional features in order to understand how to use it

Lab 1 - Temperature sensor data analysis - Mean, Range, Monotonicity, written in C

Lab 2 & 3 - Breathing LED - LED and switch interface, circuit measurements, schematics, written in assembly

Lab 4 - Debugging techniques, one switch, one LED, written in assembly

Lab 5 - Traffic Light Controller, FSMs, written in C 

Lab 6 - Digital Piano using a 4-bit DAC, written in C 

Lab 7 - LCD device driver, decimal fixed-point output, local variables, written in assembly

Lab 8 - Real-time position monitor, ADC, interrupts, LCD, mixture of assembly and C

Final Project - Game design competition, written in C... implemented a spin-off of Frogger
